# Project 2: Nondeterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Justin Raver, Nick Stolarow
* Class: CS361 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2021

## Overview

This program models an instance of a non-deterministic finite automaton.

This program implements NFA and NFAState. The NFA's can be created and
tested using the NFADriver class along with the supplied testing files.
NFA is implemented using the definition of a NFA with the 5-tuple
(Q, Σ, δ, q0, F ).

## Compiling and Using

```
 From the directory containing all .java files:
 
 Build: javac * .java
 
 Run: java fa.nfa.NFADriver ./tests/<test name>
 
```

## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't have to answer all of them in order - they are a
guideline to get you thinking.

* What problems did you have? What went well?
* What process did you go through to create the program?
* What did you have to research and learn on your own?
* What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
* What parts of the project did you find challenging?
* Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?
* Is there anything that you would change about the project?
* Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

## Testing

We tested our program thoroughly using the supplied test cases in the project description and the test cases 
posted on Piazza.
Through our testing we were able to confirm that our program works as expected.
